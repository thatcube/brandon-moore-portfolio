        <h3 className={responsiveTitle3}>I'm Brandon, a product designer with a passion for design and tech. I love design systems, CSS, and beautiful products that are built for everyone.</h3>
        <p>I'm currently working for CBORD, focusing on their consumer-facing products. I've been <AniLink fade duration={0.5} to={`/project/get`}>redesigning an entire app</AniLink> in the higher education space and in that process, I learned a lot about inclusive design and accessibility. I believe that designing for some leads to better solutions for all. Some other design-related interests include iconography, illustration, and animation.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I love soccer, volleyball, and running.</p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
