              <p>I'm currently working for CBORD, focusing on their consumer-facing products. I've been <AniLink paintDrip duration={0.5} to={`/project/get`}>redesigning an entire app</AniLink> in the higher education space and in that process, I learned a lot about inclusive design and accessibility. I believe that designing for some leads to better solutions for all. Some other design-related interests include iconography, illustration, and animation.</p>
              <p>Outside of work, I enjoy soccer, volleyball, and running.</p>
              <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
